# Calculadora-Media-MIEI
A simple project that calculates my course average grade and other statistics (Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Inform√°tica FCT - UNL). Built in 2021 when I was learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Updating it in 2024 to (drastically) improve the code quality and to allow for the master's averages to be calculated too (before you could only calculate the first 3 years grades').
